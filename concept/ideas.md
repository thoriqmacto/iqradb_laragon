# IDEAS

This is a curated list for all ideas that coming to my mind. Regardless of their possibility to implement in the codebase is outside of this list. The purpose of this list is to keep all the ideas out of my mind and could be revisit later. Any ideas follow-up would be decided later in FEATURES list.

- Basic user login/logout, to access administration panel, using JWT authentication.
